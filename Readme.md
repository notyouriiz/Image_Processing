# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Overview

This document provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in **image processing**, from basic pixel representation to advanced techniques like morphological operations, region properties, and image enhancement.

## 1. Introduction to Image Processing
Image processing is the technique of performing operations on an image to improve its quality, extract useful information, or prepare it for further analysis.  
Applications include:
- Computer vision (object detection, face recognition, medical imaging)
- Graphics (image compression, enhancement, restoration)
- Industrial automation (defect detection, quality control)

## 2. Pixels and RGB Conversion to Grayscale
- **Pixel**: The smallest unit of an image that represents intensity/color.  
- **RGB Images**: Composed of **Red, Green, and Blue** channels.  
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Reduces a color image to intensity values (0‚Äì255).  

Formula (weighted method):  
- Gray = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B
<br>This reduces complexity while preserving brightness information.

## 3. Morphological Operations
Morphological operations process images based on their shapes, commonly used on binary images.  

- **Dilation**: Expands white regions, connects broken parts.  
- **Erosion**: Shrinks white regions, removes noise.  
- **Opening** = Erosion ‚Üí Dilation (removes noise while keeping shape).  
- **Closing** = Dilation ‚Üí Erosion (fills small holes, gaps).  
- **Connected Components**: Labels connected regions in a binary image for segmentation.

## 4. Color Histogram
### A. Color Histogram Representation
A **color histogram** shows the distribution of pixel intensities for each color channel.  
- **Grayscale**: Single histogram (0‚Äì255).  
- **RGB Images**: Three histograms (Red, Green, Blue).  
- Useful for image matching, retrieval, and classification.  
### B. Color Histograms: Contrast Enhancement through Normalization
Contrast enhancement improves image visibility.  
- **Histogram Normalization (Stretching)**: Expands the range of pixel values to enhance contrast.  
- **Histogram Equalization**: Redistributes intensity values to achieve a uniform histogram, improving global contrast.

## 5. Image Enhancement (Spatial Domain)
Enhancement improves image quality by directly modifying pixel values.  
- **Convolution**: Applies a filter kernel over the image.  
- **Blurring**: Reduces noise, smooths image (average filter, Gaussian blur).  
- **Sharpening**: Enhances edges and fine details (Laplacian, high-pass filter).

## 6. Image Enhancement (Frequency Domain Filtering)
Instead of pixel manipulation, operations are performed in the **frequency domain** using Fourier Transform.  
- **Low-pass filtering**: Keeps low frequencies ‚Üí smooths image (blurring).  
- **High-pass filtering**: Keeps high frequencies ‚Üí enhances edges (sharpening).  
- **Band-pass filtering**: Keeps a specific frequency range ‚Üí useful for texture analysis.  
4. **Histograms and contrast enhancement**
5. **Spatial and frequency domain filters**  

‚Ä¶we can build strong foundations for advanced applications in **computer vision, AI, and multimedia systems**.
